This is for brainstorming the changes intended to the overall design of the current analysis suite

Step 1 - First Steps
-Read in mcd and medpc to generate several .m
-----A mess of processing which led to 02_new -- This needs to be documented and then updated

Step 2a---Spectrum Analysis
what a mess this is...

Step2b---For Spike Sorting
-Generate .bin for Offline Spike Sorter
-Spike Sorting
-Generation of .txt files
-Reading in of txt and adding to .m

Step3
Conversion to Chris File format (pevt etc)
	-conversion script - Generates mXXDYY_ZZ.mat files right now (m22D10_03.mat)
	-DriverFunction (Currently Several Saving to the sama data file, which is pretty odd)
	-mkperievent --- Working to split this up in branch now
	-DPrime-MkSelIdx_LINSENBARDTDN_XX.m
	-DPrimeDetails.m
	-figures at Testing_boundedines script / some plots2functionize

Changes made/tomake in FurtherSplitMkPeri

MKperievent split
Currently, overly complex GenArray
Trying
-WantedFiles
-SimpleGenArray
-mkperievt that also saves stats about the split
-doing this alongside adding getting the number of surrounding presses
-perhaps getting stats is better done by saving the event arrays somehow? 
Want to be able tp specify somewhere in here a settings set to struct, and a struct name so multiple can exist in one data file.
