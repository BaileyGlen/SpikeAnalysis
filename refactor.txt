so, refactoring needs to happen here.
Currently
-Different files for RfCon, RFDel, Iso
in
 Driver - not really ok
DPrime - not ok
fig gen - not really ok

and mkperi - doesn't use a real data struct

need to refactor so that the things all use the meta data in the mat file,
particularly data.SessionType and data.SessionLength
Also, driver differences can probably be best handled by a "database" mat file

Nothing I have done is enabling new baselines



Specifics
DPrime: Need to look closely at hardcoded epochs vs passed "type" parameter
    VarList and CurVar seem duplicated


all the stuff at the end of DPrime needs to come out somewhere else
